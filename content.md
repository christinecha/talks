## How to Use Small Projects to Learn (Anything)

A presentation (and small project, in itself) by Christine Cha.

### Intro

Small projects can be the most fun and most efficient way to learn just about anything. But without the right mindset (and toolset), it can easily instead just feel like a whirlwind of procrastination and discouragement without much to show for it.

Let's walk through the process from beginning to end, tackling each potential obstacle with real, actionable steps.

### Beginning > Ideation

`toolset`
- look for small, day-to-day problems
- copy someone else's project
- improve someone else's project
- write down any/all ideas you ever have, anywhere

`mindset`
- accept that your excuses are dumb
- any idea in the hand is 1000x better a great idea in the bush
- you're just looking for a starting point

---

### Beginning > Procrastination

"Ugh, I'm such a procrastinator."

Yes, you and everyone else in the world. But if you actually want to change that, let's figure out *why*.

---

### Beginning > Procrastination > Laziness

Laziness is the most commonly offered up reasoning. But fortunately, it's the easiest one to fix!

I mean, you can't become un-lazy. That's just human nature. Sorry. But what you can do, rather easily, is basically set up traps for your lazy self so you **have** to adjust your habits.

`toolset`
- make a repo and commit something **right now**
- find a fellow lazy friend and set a work-date on the calendar
- don't start by setting aside 3 hours - set aside 10 minutes

`mindset`
- little steps are better than no steps

---

### Beginning > Procrastination > Fear of Failure

Now, a lot of people think their procrastination comes from laziness, but it's actually just a side effect of fear.

"I don't know *how* to do X, though."

"Z could do this so much better I could."

"I'll probably never finish this."

etc.

`toolset`
- find a buddy that will help you when you get stuck
- focus your project on the skills you will learn
- pick a common project, for which you can easily find help

`mindset`
- no one cares, even if your project is a big, fat failure
- just by starting a project, you're already in the top 5%
- there will always be something/someone better
- you will learn a lot, even if you quit early

---

### Beginning > Procrastination > Fear of Success

The more interesting - and lesser discussed - fear, though, is this strange fear of success. If everything goes well and your project goes through the roof, what could be better, right?

Well, no. If your project goes well, more people may see it. More people = more feedback. Positive feedback, especially feature requests and questions, can be overwhelming. Negative feedback is tough on its own.

If people actually *use* your project, you'll need to consider supporting legacy users, upgrading your database security, and adding all of these other features that you never really cared about. Akk!

`toolset`
- consider going the open-source route
- label this as a personal project from the get-go
- don't tell too many people about it

`mindset`
- if people need more features, they can build them themselves
- there's a slim chance of you even finishing this, let alone having to make this your life

---

### Middle > Discouragement

`toolset`
- make small, realistic goals
- show off your work
- always leave your work session on a high note

`mindset`
- everyone struggles - it just means you're actually learning

---

### Middle > Losing Interest

This is an interesting one, because this symptom often means you should go back to the drawing board - *not* power through.

If you're genuinely not enjoying working on this project anymore, there's no shame in putting it away and starting something else. You can always come back to it if you want.

**NOTE**
Quitting a project because your annoying coworker said, "Oh, doesn't that app already exist?" does not fall under this category. Screw that guy; everything already exists in some form.

---

### Middle > Losing Interest > Attachment (Investment Bias)

"But it took me so long to get this far!"

"But you said one idea in the hand is better than ones you haven't had yet!"

"But maybe it's just because I'm lazy, not because I don't like it!"

... etc.

Yeah, yeah. If you really enjoyed working on your project, you wouldn't need to convince me or anyone else of it.

Maybe it was a project that should have been scoped a little smaller - sometimes the length of the project tires me out, not necessarily the subject matter - but either way, you can take a break.

It's personal preference, of course, but I don’t think the benefits of learning outweigh your happiness in most cases, especially when there’s so many things you could learn that might **also** bring you happiness.

---

### Middle > Time Management

`toolset`
- find a friend and work on your projects at the same time
- be realistic about your schedule from the beginning
- long term time management = cut some days short when you get to a good place

`mindset`
- it's okay if you can only spend a tiny bit of time on your project
  - more time in between sessions often means more time for considerations and thus better code quality
