## How to Use Small Projects to Learn (Anything)

A presentation (and small project, in itself) by Christine Cha.

---

### Intro

Small projects can be the most fun and most efficient way to learn just about anything. But without the right mindset (and toolset), it can easily instead just feel like a whirlwind of procrastination and discouragement without much to show for it.

Let's walk through the process from beginning to end, tackling each task and potential obstacle with real, actionable steps.

### Beginning: Ideation

What do you want to get out of this?

1. Learn a specific, brand-new skill.
2. Improve a skill you already possess (in some degree).
3. Build a complete product using skills you already possess.

Examples:

🏓
1. Hit the ball over the net! Anywhere! With anyone!
2. Take a lesson or compete in a casual tournament.
3. Compete in an official, rated tournament.

🇫🇷
1. Complete one vocab set a day with DuoLingo.
2. Write a very simple (probably dumb) short story in French.
3. Watch a movie in French with no subtitles.

💻
1. Play with the Inspect tool in your browser.
2. Build a very limited (also probably dumb) web interaction.
3. Build a complete website.

The common threads here:

1. If you're starting completely fresh, what you need is exposure. Lots and lots of it. Yes, you will pick up bad habits. Yes, you will get confused. And yes, it would be better if you could learn the 100% best practice from Day 1, but that's nearly impossible - you would need the perfect balance of mentorship, resources, and curriculum hand-fed to you.
So, don't worry about it. Just go, experience things, and have fun.

2. If you're improving a skill that you already have in some capacity (even if you're a real beginner) - you have something to work with and some context. This is where it starts to get more fun, because you can basically start to see small previews of where you ultimately want to be. As in, you won't be able to build a full web application, but you can move around items in an array (WOW!) - which is basically all it is anyway.

3. This is when you are more advanced and feel comfortable with your skillset. At this point, it becomes much easier to start building things, but it can feel almost impossible to actually close them out properly.

#### Segmentation

I think most projects can be designed around four categories: subject, tools, form, complexity.

- **Subject:** What other genres you want to incorporate, ex. visual art, ecommerce, sports
- **Tools:** Languages, libraries, design patterns - the *hard skills* you want to learn
- **Form:** Process-focused or product-focused.
- **Complexity:** Small (one working session) to Large (months++)

**Here's an example.**
I want to use React [SUBJECT], and I want to build something to contribute to my table tennis addiction [SUBJECT], so I want a finished product [FORM] my friends and I can use. However, I'm usually too ADD to work on something for more than a weekend, so let's keep it simple [COMPLEXITY].

Ta-da! That's the "Table Times" website I built.

Or how about when I was a real, complete beginner?

I had pretty much zero JavaScript knowledge - I only knew how to store Arrays, get random numbers, and print stuff to the console. I wanted to build something very small (mostly because I had no other choice), and as usual, I was product-focused. The subject was open-ended but I really like stupid stuff.

I made an insult generator! It had two arrays, one for offensive adjectives, the other for relevant nouns. And when you click "Insult Me", it would print out something like "Smelly Butt!" or another eloquent, randomly generated pair.

Exercise:
Write down 1-3 combinations of the four categories that you would like to pursue in the near future, and pass them up to the front of the room. If we have time, we'll try and work through a few together. If you'd like, write your email on your sheet and I'll be happy to send you some ideas afterwards!


#### Okay, but I still don't have any ideas!
- Look for small, day-to-day problems
- Copy someone else's project
- Improve someone else's project
- Improve your own old projects
- Write down any/all ideas you ever have, anywhere
- Help each other! (And please stop asking your friends to sign dumb NDAs.)

#### Common Obstacles

#### Procrastination

"Ugh, I'm such a procrastinator."

Yes, you and everyone else in the world. But if you actually want to change that, let's figure out *why*.

#### Procrastination > Laziness

Laziness is the most commonly offered up reasoning. But fortunately, it's the easiest one to fix!

I mean, you can't become un-lazy. That's just human nature. Sorry. But what you can do, rather easily, is basically set up traps for your lazy self so you **have** to adjust your habits.

`toolset`
- make a repo and commit something **right now**
- find a fellow lazy friend and set a work-date on the calendar
- don't start by setting aside 3 hours - set aside 10 minutes

`mindset`
- little steps are better than no steps

#### Procrastination > Fear of Failure

Now, a lot of people think their procrastination comes from laziness, but it's actually just a side effect of fear.

"I don't know *how* to do X, though."

"Z could do this so much better I could."

"I'll probably never finish this."

etc.

`toolset`
- find a buddy that will help you when you get stuck
- focus your project on the skills you will learn, not the end product
- pick a common project, for which you can easily find help

`mindset`
- no one cares, even if your project is a big, fat failure
- just by starting a project, you're already in the top 5%
- there will always be something/someone better
- you will learn a lot, even if you quit early

#### Procrastination > Fear of Success

The more interesting - and lesser discussed - fear, though, is this strange fear of success. If everything goes well and your project goes through the roof, what could be better, right?

Well, no. If your project goes well, more people may see it. More people = more feedback. Positive feedback, especially feature requests and questions, can be overwhelming. Negative feedback is tough on its own.

If people actually *use* your project, you'll need to consider supporting legacy users, upgrading your database security, and adding all of these other features that you never really cared about. Akk!

`toolset`
- consider going the open-source route
- label this as a personal project from the get-go
- don't tell too many people about it

`mindset`
- if people need more features, they can build them themselves
- there's a slim chance of you even finishing this, let alone having to make this your life

### Middle: Doing The Work

Anatomy of A Well-Rounded Learning Environment:
```
Existing Skills + Mentors + Resources + Support + _________
```
... where the _________ is the work we're going to do.

How do we make sure we have the other stuff?

- **Existing Skills:** You have learned so many things up to this point in your life. Even if you're a complete beginner at this new skill, you can use your other experience to help you.
  - When learning programming basics, I often make analogies to drawing. It's just logic and relationships.
  - When learning more advanced skills like application architecture, I think about visual design.
- **Mentors:** This is so important, especially at the early stages. As you get more advanced, you can figure out more things on your own, but as a beginner at something, it will save you so much time and frustration if you have someone you can ping about small questions to get yourself unstuck. More advanced learners - you'll need people to bounce ideas off of, discuss questions that are less black-and-white, and generally just be inspired by.
  - Recurse Center
  - Online forums, like Stack Overflow or even Twitter
- **Support:** Non-technical support. These are people who can help celebrate your wins (no matter how small!) and make you feel like you're doing something of worth.
  - Find a buddy IRL
  - Online communities can also be awesome!
  - Demo Days
- **Resources:** There is so much stuff on the internet! It is so great! Consume lots of it, but also be aware not to trust everything at face value. Try to look up three different sources on a question if you have no other context.
  - Stack Overflow
  - Github
  - Slack communities
  - Team Treehouse
  - Lynda

#### Depth Over Breadth

Always try to dive in one level deeper than you intended. This is where you can get the real value of project-based learning, because **you** determine how far you go.

If you're learning French, for example, and you've started with DuoLingo, it's a great place to start, but it'll take you exponentially longer to learn verb conjugation by pure flashcard-style repetition. It might seem easier and more fun at first, but pull out a grammar book and struggle for a few hours reading about the various patterns. Now you don't need to memorize nearly as much!

The programming equivalent here could be libraries. Using a library is great - it should make your life easier - but if you don't truly understand what's happening under the hood, every library you use is going to take just as long to learn! Instead, dive deep into the code. Read the actual implementation of a method until you understand every line.

Seriously, if that's the only takeaway I can offer, that's the one.

On another note, though, this can be pretty grueling. You don't have to do it all the time. You don't have to read through the entire Babel repository. You don't have to finish your French grammar book from cover to cover. But just little pieces will boost your learning exponentially.

#### Common Obstacles

#### Discouragement

`toolset`
- make small, realistic goals
- show off your work
- always leave your work session on a high note

`mindset`
- everyone struggles - it just means you're actually learning

---

#### Losing Interest

This is an interesting one, because this symptom often means you should go back to the drawing board - *not* power through.

If you're genuinely not enjoying working on this project anymore, there's no shame in putting it away and starting something else. You can always come back to it if you want.

**NOTE**
Quitting a project because your annoying coworker said, "Oh, doesn't that app already exist?" does not fall under this category. Screw that guy; everything already exists in some form.

`toolset`
- keep track of the progress you *did* make
- figure out what you can improve for the next round

---

#### Attachment (Investment Bias)

"But it took me so long to get this far!"

"But you said one idea in the hand is better than ones you haven't had yet!"

"But maybe it's just because I'm lazy, not because I don't like it!"

... etc.

Yeah, yeah. If you really enjoyed working on your project, you wouldn't need to convince me or anyone else of it.

Maybe it was a project that should have been scoped a little smaller - sometimes the length of the project tires me out, not necessarily the subject matter - but either way, you can take a break.

It's personal preference, of course, but I don’t think the benefits of learning outweigh your happiness in most cases, especially when there’s so many things you could learn that might **also** bring you happiness.

---

### Middle > Time Management

`toolset`
- find a friend and work on your projects at the same time
- be realistic about your schedule from the beginning
- long term time management = cut some days short when you get to a good place

`mindset`
- it's okay if you can only spend a tiny bit of time on your project
  - more time in between sessions often means more time for considerations and thus better code quality

---

### End: Closing The Loop

For me, this is the hardest part. In fact, it was even difficult for me to work on how to wrap up this talk. But every once in a while, it works! And here's a little analysis on why.

What does the finish line look like?

1. **Stop.** Stop working on the project! Put the pencil down, close your IDE, send up your last deploy.
2. **Document.** Even if it's really rag-tag, put together a README. Make a text-only static website. Tweet about it. Email it to your friend. Put it into the world - whatever that means for you.
3. **Review.** Where are we? What would you do if you were to continue working on this? What can we do better next time? This doesn't necessarily have to be a written exercise, but it's really important to analyze your previous work before you move on.

#### Common Obstacles

#### Scope Creep
"Wouldn't it be awesome if... ?"

Yes. Along with million other features. But 1) adding to your scope can dilute the quality of what you wanted to do in the first place, and 2) it can become impossible to end the project when you keep adding requirements.

You can always add features in v2.

#### Bike Shedding

```
In 1957, Parkinson observed that a committee whose job is to approve plans for a nuclear power plant may spend the majority of its time on relatively unimportant but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bikeshed, while neglecting the design of the power plant itself.
```

Hence, the term bike shedding. This is similar to scope creep in terms of its dangers - you go down these rabbit holes and you find that you've gotten nowhere on your original project!

If you have a bike shed idea, jot it down for V2.

**NOTE**

There are instances where you start going down these rabbit holes and they actually turn out way more interesting than the original project! If that seems to be happening to you, **go for it!** But remember, you should then treat that like a completely new project, with different goals. If you don't enter a new mindset when you pivot like that, you may arrive at the end feeling like you've done nothing at all.

#### Fear of Public Response


#### Perfectionism
